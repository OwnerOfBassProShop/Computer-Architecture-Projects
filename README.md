# Computer-Architecture-Projects
Collection of projects I have worked on during the computer architecture course.
In working with a lower level coding language C I have learned a great deal about the innerworkings of computers and much more. Such as recommended coding practices, how to optimize complex projects and how the computer interprets assembly to realize a coding project.
